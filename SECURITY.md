# security

## reporting a vulnerability

email **security@unauth.dev** with what you found, how to reproduce it, and
the version you tested. plain text is fine, no pgp required yet.

we aim to acknowledge within 72 hours, give a triage verdict within 7 days,
and ship a fix or mitigation within 30 days for confirmed issues. please
give us that window before disclosing publicly.

## who maintains this

aicheck is built and maintained by one person: **Raúl Acedo**
(https://unauth.dev/about). reports go to the maintainer directly. there is
no separate security team or outsourced triage.

## supported versions

only the latest 2.x release gets fixes. upgrade before reporting against an
older version.

| version | supported |
|---|---|
| 2.x (latest) | yes |
| 1.x | no (frozen leftover live-probe Action) |
| anything older | no |

## one ground rule

we will never ask for your credentials. aicheck needs none and sends nothing anywhere.
